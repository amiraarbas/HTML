<h2>Petra</h2>
<p>Inhabited since prehistoric times, this <b> Nabataean </b> caravan-city,
 situated between the Red Sea and the <b> Dead Sea </b> , was an important crossroads between Arabia, Egypt and Syria-Phoenicia. Petra is half-built, half-carved into the rock, and is surrounded
 by mountains riddled with passages and gorges. It is one of the world's most famous archaeological sites, where ancient <b> Eastern </b> traditions blend with <b> Hellenistic </b> architecture.  </p>
